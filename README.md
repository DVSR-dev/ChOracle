# ChOracle A Discord Chore Bot

## Summary
ChOracle is a sophisticated task management system designed to help communities maintain accountability for regular chores and responsibilities. Through automated reminders and peer verification, it creates a structured yet friendly environment for task completion and verification.

## Core Features
- **Scheduled Reminders**: Create daily, weekly, or monthly reminders for tasks
- **Peer Verification System**: Integrates a peer review system to verify task completion
- **Interactive Reactions**: Use simple emoji reactions for task management
- **Follow-up System**: Automated follow-ups for incomplete tasks
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Support for various time intervals and specific days

## How It Works

### Basic Flow
1. User sets up a reminder for a chore
2. Bot sends reminder at scheduled time
3. User marks task as complete (üëç)
4. Peers verify completion
5. Bot schedules next reminder

### Peer Verification Process
1. When a user claims task completion:
   - Bot notifies peers for verification
   - Peers can confirm (üëç) or reject (üëé) the completion
2. On confirmation:
   - Task is marked complete
   - Next reminder is scheduled
3. On rejection:
   - User is notified to complete the task properly
   - Follow-up reminder is scheduled
   - Bot maintains the reminder cycle

## User Interaction Guide

### Responding to Reminders
1. When you receive a reminder, react with:
   - üëç to mark as complete
   - üëé to postpone by 1 hour

### For Peers
1. When a user marks a task complete:
   - You'll receive a verification request
   - Check the task completion
   - React with üëç to confirm or üëé if incomplete

### Task Rejection Flow
If a peer rejects task completion:
1. User receives notification
2. Can react with üëç when properly completed
3. Receives follow-up reminder after 1 hour
4. Regular reminder cycle continues

## Day Numbering Convention
For weekly schedules:
- 0 = Monday
- 1 = Tuesday
- 2 = Wednesday
- 3 = Thursday
- 4 = Friday
- 5 = Saturday
- 6 = Sunday

## Best Practices
1. **Setting Reminders**:
   - Choose appropriate intervals
   - Set realistic times
   - Use clear, descriptive chore names

2. **Peer Verification**:
   - Verify tasks promptly
   - Provide constructive feedback
   - Be consistent with verification standards

3. **Managing Reminders**:

   - Remove obsolete reminders
   - Update schedules as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
